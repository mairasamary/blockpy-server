"Number of <Abstraction Row>"
Better "Still loading" screen for Visualizer
Reset title if changing graph

Better explanations of when it's time on the x-axis?

* Fix copy/paste for now block
* Scatter Plot Sampling
* Right side number clipping
* Internet Explorer semantic checker is broken
* Look into the semantic checker's line number - it might be reporting the wrong number? (Safari)
* Safari seems to not be reporting successes
* Nested semantic checker for branches -
    if something
        set
        if something
            set
    else:
        set
* Fix the semantic checker for dataset access functions

* Remove weather, earthquake, etc. from the old datasets
* Possibly remove trace builtin (in favor _trace) for performance reasons.


Plot the death years for the artists as a histogram. Note that authors who haven't died have been stored as 0. Observe the output, and then create a new histogram where 0 have been filtered out.
